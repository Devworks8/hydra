#	KeyMonkey uses an OpenSSH-like key storage directory: ~/.curve/
#
#	Your public key is stored in the ~/.curve/id_curve.key file.
#	Your private key is stored in the ~/.curve/id_curve.key_secret file.
#
#	Remote servers you want to connect to as a client will require the server's key to be in:
#
#	~/.curve/servername.key
#
#	...and you will need to specify "servername" in your setupClient call:
#	self.async = key_monkey.setupClient(self.async, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5000", "servername")
#
#	At this point, assuming the server has just done a similar call to setupServer(), you will
#	be able to communicate with the remote server.

#	It is also possible to improve security even further! To do this, you will need to set up
#	an ZAP 'authenticator' thread on the server side, which will ensure that you will only allow
#	connections from authorized clients. This is NOT set up by default.
#
#	Clients that you want to authorize to connect to your server should have their public keys
#	stored in:
#
#	~/.curve/authorized_clients/clientname.key
